=====================
for using this repository you will need a eclipse installation with google adt and m2e installed. Import the server project as "maven project".

I personally use 2 different eclipse versions for the server and the android app. that is the reason for the folder structure, but that's up to personal preference.

Have fun expanding or editing my project.
